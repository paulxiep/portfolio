## Catan

Catan or Settlers of Catan is a classic popular board game. I only just in February 2023 started playing it. I found some academic papers on Catan strategy and algorithm and I wanted to see how well I can make one too.

Currently I have no AI or interactive UI yet, but I've written the underlying engine of generic hex board and catan hex board with hexes, edges, and corners, and their topographic information.

A basic visualization in tkinter of the board has also been written.

This is the state of this project right now. Engine and basic drawings.

Next will come the interactive UI, and then the AI will follow.
