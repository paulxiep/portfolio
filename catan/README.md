## Catan

Catan or Settlers of Catan is a popular classic board game. I only just in February 2023 started playing it. I found some academic papers on Catan strategy and algorithm and I wanted to see how well I can make one too.

Currently I have no AI yet, but I've written the underlying engine of generic hex board and catan hex board with hexes, edges, and corners, and their topographic information.

A basic visualization an interactive UI in tkinter of the board and play session has also been written.

This is the state of this project right now. Hex geometry engine, basic drawings, and play session.

Next I'll be cleaning up, refactoring, adding comments, and deciding on the AI.
