//! Agent trait and type definitions for the trading simulation.
//!
//! This module defines the core `Agent` trait that all trading agents must implement,
//! as well as the `StrategyContext` they receive each tick.
//!
//! # V3.1 Multi-Symbol Support
//!
//! Agents can now track positions across multiple symbols:
//! - `positions()` returns a map of symbol → position entry
//! - `watched_symbols()` declares symbols for Tier 2 wake conditions
//! - Backward-compatible: `position()` returns aggregate across all symbols
//!
//! # V2.3 Changes
//!
//! The `on_tick` method receives `StrategyContext<'_>` which provides
//! multi-symbol access via the `MarketView` trait.
//!
//! # State Management
//!
//! All agents must provide access to their `AgentState` via the `state()` method.
//! This enables automatic tracking of position, cash, and realized P&L.

/// The core trait that all trading agents must implement.
///
/// Agents are called once per tick with a `StrategyContext` providing
/// access to market state, indicators, and historical data.
///
/// # V2.3 Changes
///
/// The `on_tick` method now receives `StrategyContext<'_>` instead of `MarketData`.
/// This enables multi-symbol access through the `MarketView` trait.

/// # Lifetimes
///
/// The `StrategyContext` parameter borrows from the simulation state, so agents
/// cannot store references to it. They should extract any needed data during
/// the `on_tick` call.
///
/// # Example
/// ```ignore
/// struct SimpleAgent {
///     id: AgentId,
///     symbol: String,
/// }
///
/// impl Agent for SimpleAgent {
///     fn id(&self) -> AgentId { self.id }

///     fn on_tick(&mut self, ctx: &StrategyContext<'_>) -> AgentAction {
///         // Access market data for our symbol
///         let mid = ctx.mid_price(&self.symbol);
///         let rsi = ctx.get_indicator(&self.symbol, IndicatorType::Rsi(14));
