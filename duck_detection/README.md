### Duck Detection

I meant to use this project to show I can work with images, 
but the task turned out to be too easy 
(and I don't have much more data to improve it further - 
only 127 train and 30 validaiton images were used). 

Tech-wise I only just used most of yolov7 code as is. 

Nevertheless, I uploaded the simple data converter from labelstudio's json format to yolo format. The sample json format can be found in data/raw

Then the results from model prediction can be found in the 2 videos below.
