# Portfolio

**This portfolio is only meant to supplement my employment experience, not replace it.**

**Certificates in the [certificates](certificates) folder**

It is both a place to showcase my other skills aside from what I demonstrated in work, and for me to develop new skills via new projects.

Skills aimed to demonstrate/practice with each project are:

    1. 7_wonders: Reinforcement learning using Gymnasium library. OOP. Only implemented Deep-Q Learning for now.
    2. catan: Object-oriented programming, practical AI programming.
    3. cities_skylines_transport_ridership: Basic data visualization using Seaborn.
    4. duck_detection: Basic object detection and json data manipulation.
    5. geospatial: Geospatial Data Science, still only a practice ground. I have yet to find a dataset I like to work with and make something fruitful out of it.

With the exception of 7 Wonders and Catan, the rest are 1-day projects (3, 4) or practice range (5).

More project info can be found on the projects' own readme.

## Planned projects

Will be worked on in order of evaluated usefulness and urgency of need. (still unsure about the order)
