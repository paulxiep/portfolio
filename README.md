# Portfolio

Even though this repository is called 'portfolio', it has evolved to be more like a playground for my experiments.

Currently the most developed project is 'catan'. I wrote the engine for the board game catan from scratch, then wrote an application for playing it. Now I'm writing simulation game to generate data to train AI with reinforcement learning.
