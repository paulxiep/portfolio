# Portfolio

**This portfolio is only meant to supplement my employment experience, not replace it.**

**Certificates in the [certificates](certificates) folder**

It is both a place to showcase my other skills aside from what I demonstrated in work, and for me to develop new skills via new projects.

Skills aimed to demonstrate/practice with each project are:

1. [7_wonders](7_wonders): Reinforcement learning using Gymnasium library. OOP. Only implemented Deep-Q Learning for now.
2. [catan](catan): Object-oriented programming, practical AI programming.
3. [earth_surface_temperature](earth_surface_temperature): Interactive dashboard using Plotly and Streamlit.
4. [cities_skylines_transport_ridership](cities_skylines_transport_ridership): Basic data visualization using Seaborn.
5. [duck_detection](duck_detection): Basic object detection and json data manipulation.
6. [geospatial](geospatial): Geospatial Data Science, still only a practice ground. I have yet to find a dataset I like to work with and make something fruitful out of it.

With the exception of 7 Wonders and Catan, the rest are 1-day projects (3, 4, 5) or practice range (6).

More project info can be found on the projects' own readme.

## Planned projects

Will be worked on in order of evaluated usefulness and urgency of need. (still unsure about the order)

**I've worked on this portfolio 6 days a week non-stop for 5 months and I'm burned out. I'll be 'on vacation' from projects until I take down this notice.**

- (More) Interactive Dashboards: I'll need to find suitable data
- NLP (fine-tuning): I've tried fine-tuning of BERT model with Kaggle data, but I'm not satisfied with the results. In any case it's a simple task so I might be working on self-supervised learning first.
- NLP (self-supervised learning): This will be a long one, because I'll have to write the whole pipeline from web-scraping and then study some model code to build my own from scratch.
- Data Engineering: I'll be taking a professional certificate program. Should take me ~14 days.
- Generative AI: I'll be taking introductory course to generative AI to get started. Should take me ~7 days.
