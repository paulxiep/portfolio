# Portfolio

**This portfolio is only meant to supplement my employment experience, not replace it.**

**Certificates in the [certificates](certificates) folder**

It is both a place to showcase my other skills aside from what I demonstrated in work, and for me to develop new skills via new projects.

As expansion to my latest venture into RAG and Vector databases, I'm ideating a **code-topology-construction** for any generic repository code. The topology constructor will recursively cluster functions into emergent architectural understanding, somewhat like RAPTOR for code repositories.

Projects are divided into 2025+ and 2023-24, which correlates to AI-assisted (2025+) vs 100% hand-write (2023-24)

## 2025 onwards (AI-assisted projects)

1. [portfolio-rag-chat](portfolio-rag-chat): Chatbot and RAG implemented in Rust. Uses chatbot to answer questions about this portfolio.

## 2023-2024 (100% hand-written)

1. [7_wonders](7_wonders): Reinforcement learning using Gymnasium library. OOP. Only implemented Deep-Q Learning for now.
2. [catan](catan): Object-oriented programming, practical AI programming.
3. [simple_machine_learning_deployments](simple_machine_learning_deployments): Machine Learning Engineering, Airflow, Flask
4. [earth_surface_temperature](earth_surface_temperature): Interactive dashboard using Plotly and Streamlit.
5. [24_plus_solver](24_plus_solver): This is mainly a toy project for a challenge, made use of advanced Python syntax like generator and overloading. 
6. [chat_csv](chat_csv): Chatbot app that allows you to ask questions about your csv or postgresql data.
7. [sentiment_analysis](sentiment_analysis): NLP. Sentiment Analysis. Web-scraping.
8. [duck_detection](duck_detection): Basic object detection and json data manipulation.functions.

Sentiment Analysis, 7 Wonders, Catan, Simple ML Deployments, and Chat CSV are multi-day projects spanning a few days or weeks, 
the rest are 1-day projects.

More project info can be found on the projects' own readme.
