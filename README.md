# Portfolio

**This portfolio is only meant to supplement my employment experience, not replace it.**

**Certificates in the [certificates](certificates) folder**

It is both a place to showcase my other skills aside from what I demonstrated in work, and for me to develop new skills via new projects.

Skills aimed to demonstrate/practice with each project are:

1. [7_wonders](7_wonders): Reinforcement learning using Gymnasium library. OOP. Only implemented Deep-Q Learning for now.
2. [catan](catan): Object-oriented programming, practical AI programming.
3. [earth_surface_temperature](earth_surface_temperature): Interactive dashboard
4. [cities_skylines_transport_ridership](cities_skylines_transport_ridership): Basic data visualization using Seaborn.
5. [duck_detection](duck_detection): Basic object detection and json data manipulation.
6. [geospatial](geospatial): Geospatial Data Science, still only a practice ground. I have yet to find a dataset I like to work with and make something fruitful out of it.

With the exception of 7 Wonders and Catan, the rest are 1-day projects (3, 4, 5) or practice range (6).

More project info can be found on the projects' own readme.

## Planned projects

Will be worked on in order of evaluated usefulness and urgency of need. (still unsure about the order)

    - (More) Interactive Dashboards
    - NLP
