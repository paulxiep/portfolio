# Portfolio

**This portfolio is only meant to supplement my employment experience, not replace it.**

**Certificates in the [certificates](certificates) folder**

It is both a place to showcase my other skills aside from what I demonstrated in work, and for me to develop new skills via new projects.

Projects are divided into 2025+ and 2023-24, which correlates to AI-assisted (2025+) vs 100% hand-write (2023-24).

I'm currently testing and pushing the boundaries of AI-assisted coding on [quant-trading-gym](quant-trading-gym) project.

More project info can be found on the projects' own readme.

## 2025 onwards (AI-assisted projects)

1. [quant-trading-gym](quant-trading-gym) (Rust - for now): a quantitative trading simulation in Rust with RL training in Python, modular quant strategies, risk management, microservices architecture, and chatbot interface to execute trading API.
2. [portfolio-rag-chat](portfolio-rag-chat) (Rust + Dockerfile): Chatbot and RAG implemented in Rust. Uses chatbot to answer questions about this portfolio.

## 2023-2024 (100% hand-written)

1. [7_wonders](7_wonders) (Python): Reinforcement learning using Gymnasium library. OOP. Only implemented Deep-Q Learning for now.
2. [catan](catan) (Python): Object-oriented programming, practical AI programming.
3. [simple_machine_learning_deployments](simple_machine_learning_deployments) (Python + Dockerfile): Machine Learning Engineering, Airflow, Flask
4. [earth_surface_temperature](earth_surface_temperature) (Python): Interactive dashboard using Plotly and Streamlit.
5. [24_plus_solver](24_plus_solver) (Python): This is mainly a toy project for a challenge, made use of advanced Python syntax like generator and overloading. 
6. [chat_csv](chat_csv) (Python): Chatbot app that allows you to ask questions about your csv or postgresql data.
7. [sentiment_analysis](sentiment_analysis) (Python): NLP. Sentiment Analysis. Web-scraping..

Sentiment Analysis, 7 Wonders, Catan, Simple ML Deployments, and Chat CSV are multi-day projects spanning a few days or weeks, 
the rest are 1-day projects.

## 1 planned projects, for the future

1. **code-topology-construction**: for any generic repository code (as expansion to my latest venture into RAG and Vector databases). The topology constructor will recursively cluster functions into emergent architectural understanding, somewhat like RAPTOR for code repositories. This is more research-focused and will require me to study related technologies and researches first.
