## Portfolio RAG Chat

This is my first LLM-era portfolio project. The AI coding assistant has changed the portfolio game.

This project was (with planned Shuttle deployment removed) completed within 1 day. I'm starting to question what kind of problems I should solve to both be useful, add new skills and have some level of challenge.

**An alternative deployment to Shuttle will be figured out ASAP.**

**There'll be another update to simplify set up and access,** but the core engine are now functional.

### Purpose

- To practice and demonstrate familiarity with
  - Rust
  - RAG
  - Chatbot Application
- To function as meta-project
  - To answer questions about my portfolio

### Tech Stack

- **LLM**: Google Gemini (via rig-core)
- **Vector DB**: LanceDB

- **Frontend**: htmx + Askama templates
